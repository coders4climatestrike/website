What are the best places from a sustainability point of view to host your services and applications? 
In this article we point you to the info we have. TL;DR: These are carbon neutral places to host @GCPcloud @Azure or @awscloud BUT ONLY Dublin, Frankfurt, Canada or Oregon (these are the sustainable regions as of Nov-2018).

 * There is a white paper called ["The state of data centre energy use in 2018"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eCCb3rgqtQxcRwLdTr0P_hCK_drIZrm1Dpb4dlPeG6M/edit)(By Paul Johnston & Anne Currie) TL;DR: these are good places to host (from a sustainability point of view): @GCPcloud @Azure or @awscloud BUT ONLY Dublin, Frankfurt, Canada or Oregon (these are the sustainable regions).
 * Tell others to host their applications at above and let the hosting poroviders know why you are using them or choosing to switch!

    -  [News article explaining the impact of using bitcoin in terms of energy usage](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/17/bitcoin-electricity-usage-huge-climate-cryptocurrency) "Bitcoin’s electricity usage is enormous. In November (2018), the power consumed by the entire bitcoin network was estimated to be higher than that of the Republic of Ireland. .... That’s commensurate with CO2 emissions of 20 megatonnes – or roughly 1m transatlantic flights."
