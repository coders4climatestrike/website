## What is carbon offsetting

Carbon offseting is when people do financial contributions to projects that help reduce CO2 emissions. A lot of the carbon offseting companies are Charities or 
Not for Profit organisations, but not all.

A good post on the subject of [How to carbon offset flights](https://charlieontravel.com/carbon-offset-flights/) which goes in depth into the common questions and what are the problems with it. It seems like not many people know about this as a possibility.

We found another really in depth post in `Ethical consumer`'s ["A short guide to carbon offsets"](https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/energy/short-guide-carbon-offsets). Interestingly, their recommendation is: 

> We recommend offsetting at the level of individual projects (rather than just giving to a company’s whole portfolio) because this is the level at which there is most information available. Accordingly, most of this feature deals with how best to choose such a project...

> If you want to buy official offsets, we recommend giving to Gold Standard-approved wind or solar energy projects. You can find Gold Standard VER projects on the Gold Standard website and you can buy Gold Standard CERs directly through the UN’s platform... 

> Recommended offset types – renewables
> There is a strong argument that renewables are the best form of official offset, as they are addressing the central structural issue that is causing climate change: our reliance on using fossil fuels for energy... 

Meanwhile, we keep collecting our first hand experiences in [Awesome carbon offset](https://github.com/coders4climatestrike/awesome-carbon-offset) please add your own by sending a PR to the repository or let us know of better ways to offset the things we can't change.
