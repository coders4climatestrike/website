## Coders4ClimateStrike

Inspired by the call to action by [Greta Thunberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg) and the many ([1]) ([2]) ([3]) recent demostrations, we want to help, with *action*.

If you have some suggestions or want to get involved talk to us via twitter [@coders4Climate](https://twitter.com/Coders4Climate)

So, as a developer/programmer/coder, what can we do? Read the different posts with suggestions of things you can change.
