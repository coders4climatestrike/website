A lot of the carbon offseting companies are Charities or  Not for Profit organisations, but not all.</p>\n\n<p>A good post on the subject of <a href=\"https://charlieontravel.com/carbon-offset-flights/\">How to carbon offset flights</a> which goes in depth into the common questions and what are the problems with it. It seems like not many people know about this as a possibility.</p>\n\n<p>We found another really in depth post in <code>Ethical consumer</code>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/energy/short-guide-carbon-offsets\">&ldquo;A short guide to carbon offsets&rdquo;</a>. Interestingly, their recommendation is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>We recommend offsetting at the level of individual projects (rather than just giving to a company’s whole portfolio) because this is the level at which there is most information available. Accordingly, most of this feature deals with how best to choose such a project&hellip;</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>If you want to buy official offsets, we recommend giving to Gold Standard-approved wind or solar energy projects. You can find Gold Standard VER projects on the Gold Standard website and you can buy Gold Standard CERs directly through the UN’s platform&hellip;</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Recommended offset types – renewables There is a strong argument that renewables are the best form of official offset, as they are addressing the central structural issue that is causing climate change: our reliance on using fossil fuels for energy&hellip;</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, we keep collecting our first hand experiences in <a href=\"https://github.com/coders4climatestrike/awesome-carbon-offset\">Awesome carbon offset</a> please add your own by sending a PR to the repository or let us know of better ways to offset the things we can&rsquo;t change.</p>")) ((p+ #"/home/andrmag1/repos/z-misc/c4c-website/_src/posts/2019-11-28-ecotalk.md" . unix) f post (u .

The phone network uses the money we spend with them to give land back to nature, improving biodiversity. With an energy provider as a parent, you&rsquo;d expect they&rsquo;d allocate green energy to cover the network use, and they do.</p>\n\n<p>Ethical Consumer magazine rated all the networks in the UK, and Ecotalk came top by some distance. Those ratings are based on a wide range of factors (human rights, marketing, military support, political activity, tax avoidance, company ethos&hellip;) as well as green credentials.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"coverage-and-plans\">Coverage and plans</h1>\n\n<p>As a virtual mobile operator, Ecotalk uses EE infrastructure. After you switch you&rsquo;ll see EE as your network. (EE by themselves were a respectable 5th in the table; Ecotalk do better because of the good/non-evil things they do with the revenue).</p>\n\n<p>The plans include 2G, 3G and 4G. There&rsquo;s no mention of 5G, but that&rsquo;s not a concern for me. Maybe I&rsquo;ll be interested in a few years.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve not tried international roaming, but it&rsquo;s the <a href=\"https://www.ecotalk.co.uk/help/roaming-abroad/using-your-mobile-abroad\">roam like at home</a>-style for travelling in the EU.</p>\n\n<p>Ecotalk offer 12 month contracts and 30 day contracts. I went for the 12 months, 10G data, unlimited calls and texts. It&rsquo;s £12/mo including VAT (at the time of writing, November 2019).</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"joining\">Joining</h1>\n\n<p>Signing up is reasonably standard:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>adding a plan to your basket and checking out;</li>\n <li>providing contact and bank account direct debit details;</li>\n <li>entering (and verifying) your email address; and</li>\n <li>setting a user name and password.</li></ul>\n\n<p>You also get to set a &ldquo;credit limit&rdquo;, which is a kind of data overdraft. If you hit your data limit, but don&rsquo;t want Ecotalk to stop your usage, you can say you&rsquo;re willing to go over by up (for example) £30.  You can set this to zero.</p>\n\n<p>I did the sign up on Sunday night, and I received a new SIM in the post on Wednesday morning:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/2019-ecotalk/sim-840x570.jpg\" width=\"840\" height=\"570\" alter=\"Photo on an EcoTalk SIM card\" /></p>\n\n<h1 id=\"keep-your-number\">Keep your number</h1>\n\n<p>Keeping your existing phone number is so much easier than the last time I switched networks. With your existing SIM (for me, this was with Three), you text PAC to 75075, and you get back a code (a PAC) that&rsquo;s valid for 30 days. I also received a confirmation from Three that &ldquo;If [I] use [the PAC] today, [my] final bill will be 0 GBP&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>Once my Ecotalk SIM had arrived, I logged into my Ecotalk account and entered the PAC. It takes up to a couple of days to switch your number over. You&rsquo;re told to wait until you lose service from your existing network, then put in the new SIM and reboot.</p>\n\n<p>I did that, but my phone (and iPhone SE) was reporting a new phone number. I was expecting to see my old (existing) number. Porting isn&rsquo;t instant, and it looks like it flips over at 6pm each evening.</p>\n\n<p>At 6pm, I rebooted, and indeed my phone was showing my old number. (On Apple devices you can view your number by Settings &gt; Phone)</p>\n\n<p>I checked a few web sites, made some calls, sent some text. The main thing I wanted to check was: did data tethering work? Yes, and it was fast.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"support-email-slow-phone-great\">Support: email slow; phone great</h1>\n\n<p>I did email Ecotalk, and the automated response is that they&rsquo;ll get back in five working days. In reality, I had a response in one or two days. However, the telephone support is great.</p>\n\n<p>I phoned Ecotalk support once, expected to be in a queue for a while, but was speaking to a human pretty much instantly. They understood exactly what I burbled at them, and had the answer. Knowledgeable and fast.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"account-access-and-billing\">Account access and billing</h1>\n\n<p>Finally, online you can view your account. It looks like this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/2019-ecotalk/account.png\" width=\"840\" height=\"1228\" alter=\"Screen shot of Ecotalk account page\" /></p>\n\n<p>You&rsquo;re billed in advance for the month, and the bill includes a VAT line, in case you need to expense that. If you&rsquo;re setting up your bill against a business, or need to change your direct debit, call them.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"summary\">Summary</h1>\n\n<p>Ecotalk is the most ethical phone network in the UK. It works. It&rsquo;s easy to switch. You should consider it.</p>")) ((p+ #"/home/andrmag1/repos/z-misc/c4c-website/_src/posts/2019-11-17-voting-with-your-wallet.md" . unix) f post (u .
