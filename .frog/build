A lot of the carbon offseting companies are Charities or  Not for Profit organisations, but not all.</p>\n\n<p>A good post on the subject of <a href=\"https://charlieontravel.com/carbon-offset-flights/\">How to carbon offset flights</a> which goes in depth into the common questions and what are the problems with it. It seems like not many people know about this as a possibility.</p>\n\n<p>We found another really in depth post in <code>Ethical consumer</code>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/energy/short-guide-carbon-offsets\">&ldquo;A short guide to carbon offsets&rdquo;</a>. Interestingly, their recommendation is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>We recommend offsetting at the level of individual projects (rather than just giving to a company’s whole portfolio) because this is the level at which there is most information available. Accordingly, most of this feature deals with how best to choose such a project&hellip;</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>If you want to buy official offsets, we recommend giving to Gold Standard-approved wind or solar energy projects. You can find Gold Standard VER projects on the Gold Standard website and you can buy Gold Standard CERs directly through the UN’s platform&hellip;</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Recommended offset types – renewables There is a strong argument that renewables are the best form of official offset, as they are addressing the central structural issue that is causing climate change: our reliance on using fossil fuels for energy&hellip;</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, we keep collecting our first hand experiences in <a href=\"https://github.com/coders4climatestrike/awesome-carbon-offset\">Awesome carbon offset</a> please add your own by sending a PR to the repository or let us know of better ways to offset the things we can&rsquo;t change.</p>")) ((? . 2) f post (u .

Basically turn up at your chosen lunch place, ask them politely and they might even give you a small discount too!!
