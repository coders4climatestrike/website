We convert boats, buses, cars, and trucks to electric drive, often complete vehicle fleets. We work with both battery and hydrogen powered vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>The company was founded in The Netherlands in 2008 by Anne Kloppenborg a friend and colleague for many years. The workshop in Ireland was established in 2018.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/2020-newireland/marine_tugboat.jpeg\" width=\"400\" alter=\"Electric marine tugboat \" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-do-these-car-conversions-work\">How do these car conversions work?</h3>\n\n<p>At New Electric Ireland we sometimes do the car conversions, we also sometimes sponsor other people to do it. However, most impact comes from teaching people to do it, so we do all the admin work, provide workshop space, etc to enable that.</p>\n\n<p>Ireland is a real hub for development. We are lucky to work with <a href=\"https://www.evbmw.com/\">Damien Maguire</a>, an exceptional engineering talent. He runs our courses and has been converting cars for more than a decade.</p>\n\n<p>There are two things driving this forward:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>We want to extend the life of existing vehicles</li>\n <li>We want to ensure this can be achieved at low cost, since new electric vehicles are fairly expensive. Two years ago Damien was able to make a conversion for just €1000. This vehicle has a 40 mile range.</li></ul>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/2020-newireland/2020-05-workshop-small.jpg\" width=\"400\" alter=\"Car workshop showing a Jaguar and a Mini\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" title=\"Car workshop showing a Jaguar and a Mini\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"i-see-there-are-a-lot-of-open-source-references-in-the-httpsopeninverterorgforumopen-inverter-website-can-you-tell-us-a-little-about-you-and-open-source-projects\">I see there are a lot of Open Source references in the <a href=\"https://openinverter.org/forum/\">Open Inverter website</a>. Can you tell us a little about you and Open Source projects?</h3>\n\n<p>We have been supporting open source for many years both financially and donating equipment. My main business is in the medical field in the US.  The business is very successful and the core of the technology is open source. I fully endorse open source and it can be made a viable business, it doesn&rsquo;t need to be a charitable exercise.</p>\n\n<p>In the electric car space, we wanted to formalise our support, that&rsquo;s why when I was coming to Ireland, we took a decision to set up a facility to teach people about conversions and open source. We&rsquo;re currently teaching about 100 people a year. We also undertake open source R&amp;D.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/2020-newireland/2020-05-wip.jpeg\" width=\"400\" alter=\"Car conversion in progress\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"is-there-anything-happening-at-the-moment-that-enables-the-car-conversions\">Is there anything happening at the moment that enables the car conversions?</h3>\n\n<p>What has become obvious is that a lot of the components that are being used in electric vehicles, particularly hybrids, are available at a very low price point. For instance the Toyota Prius inverter, the 2nd and 3rd generations of those, are capable of over 300 horsepower and Damien (Maguire) recently bought one for €40 - to think that five years ago we were spending €500 for an inverter!</p>\n\n<p>If you buy a bespoke inverter and you have a fault, you are very dependent on that manufacturer, but if you buy from, say Toyota, you can buy the part off the shelf.</p>\n\n<p>We have been trying hard to understand the capabilities of OEM components because we want to put together a very capable platform. Our current goal is to get a solid 200 mile range with 250kW charging and 300 horsepower for €7000.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, we are aiming for a conversion with a bolting kit that enables the procedure to be completed in a day - assuming a moderate mechanical skill level.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"so-you-run-the-courses-are-they-for-mechanics-only\">So you run the courses. Are they for mechanics only?</h3>\n\n<p>About a third of the people enrolled for our courses are professional car mechanics. The car aspect of the conversion process is not that large. We want to try to help with this by making the process more like a bolt in kit.</p>\n\n<p>People with less experience in mechanics tend to struggle more, since Open Inverter has many users with a great deal of domain expertise that can be difficult to understand for the layperson. However, there are five or six builds going on today where people are making good progress and intend to give back to the community. Learners providing feedback into the community will help to bridge the gap of experience and ease the transition for newcomers.</p>\n\n<p>One can imagine a car conversion group, the same way you would have a woodworking group. In that group there would be at least one person who has performed a conversion before, so that together the group can assist each other and make more conversions.</p>\n\n<p>Part of what we want to do with Open Inverter is to stop reinventing the wheel. There is always new stuff out there, but we think that we now have found all the key components we need and we can now get to build a bolt in kit - and when I say we - I mean the community.</p>\n\n<p>Undoubtedly there will be companies producing things to make the process simpler. For instance, a coupler that locks up the Lexus GS450 transmission is a bolt-in piece that we need. Whilst it is not a particularly complicated thing to make yourself, if you don&rsquo;t have the metalworking skills it could present quite a challenge. More companies producing these kinds of things helps to bring the conversion process within the scope of more people.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/2020-newireland/2020-05-battery-packs.jpeg\" width=\"400\" alter=\"Car workshop showing a Jaguar and a Mini\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-are-some-benefits-of-open-development-you-have-personally-experienced\">What are some benefits of open development you have personally experienced?</h3>\n\n<p>I guess it&rsquo;s simpler to show with some examples: There is a fantastic project called Open Vehicles. It&rsquo;s a monitoring and control tool that has been developed in the last decade. Open Vehicles gives you all the remote features that you would have on a Tesla. We hope to incorporate it with Open Inverter, it would give a whole new level of control over the converted vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>Another example is: recently we reversed engineered the Tesla Model 3 charger, it uses CCS charging (rapid charging standard for Europe). With CCS you can charge up to 250KW, meaning you can top up your battery in a few minutes. We can use that technology in the converted cars, and there is no reason why people can&rsquo;t take that technology to update an existing electric car. There are a lot of extra benefits.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"are-you-hoping-to-open-many-locations-to-teach-people-to-convert-cars\">Are you hoping to open many locations to teach people to convert cars?</h3>\n\n<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be our company that does this. This is where we want the community at large to take over. What we are particularly hoping is that people from the course will pick it up and run with it, perhaps creating their own groups, workshops and educational material. We can&rsquo;t possibly service the billion odd cars that are out there. It is much more important that we teach people with an ethos of community and sharing.</p>\n\n<p>We are fortunate in that we can basically run this as a non-profit, because we are part of a group of companies and because Anne and myself are both very passionate about trying to grow the number of clean vehicles. This is our contribution to stop climate change.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"if-a-software-developer-wanted-to-get-involved-in-this-project-somehow-is-there-anything-particular-she-should-look-at\">If a software developer wanted to get involved in this project somehow, is there anything particular she should look at?</h3>\n\n<p>An obvious start would be Open Vehicles, the monitoring system. This is an important software project. It needs consistent focus from some software people so that it can be used by Open Inverter.</p>\n\n<p>A video how to install Open Inverter and a high level overview of what it provides:</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9Fsbvd1Kfg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<h4 id=\"do-the-thing\">Do the thing!!</h4>\n\n<p>So, you read this far and you are interested in trying to do something?

Around 2007&ndash;2008 time I started looking at car conversions to electric in anger, the stumbling block was always high costs. It was hard to get into, particularly in Europe. Everything needed to come from the USA. I priced all the parts and it came to somewhere between €15000 and €20000. That amount was for parts excluding batteries. The project used a basic DC motor, forklift controller, a very basic setup by today&rsquo;s standards. It was completely off putting.</p>\n\n<p>Around 2009 I came across [Paul Holmes], in the US <a href=\"https://www.instructables.com/id/Homemade-100-HP-Motor-Controller-for-an-Electric-C/\">Instructables</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/MPaulHolmes/videos\">youtube</a> he was developing an open source <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_controller\">DC motor controller</a>. I am an electronics engineer by profession. I specialised in power electronics, so I was able to get involved with it. I ordered his kit for about €150 and bought a forklift motor for a few hundred euros and before I knew it I had a car that moved without engine power!</p>\n\n<p>I thought I would convert one or two cars maybe, but there were more parts, components, ideas and ways of doing things becoming available. Then there was these <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_battery\">&ldquo;Lithium batteries&rdquo;</a> they promised things that seem impossible in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead%E2%80%93acid_battery\">Lead acid</a> era.</p>\n\n<p>My first electric car project went 12.5 miles with lead acid batteries, the batteries weighed 600kg. I changed that to a lithium battery pack in 2012 or 2013. The new battery pack weighed 140kg and the car went 40miles.</p>\n\n<p>I got another car, a BMW 5 Series that houses a 38kwh lithium battery that can go 110 miles and can drive on the motorway, and go wherever I wanted to go with it.</p>\n\n<p>It has been quite a journey and I’m happy to be doing this full time for the last 3 years .</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EvBmw/status/1265583482572541957\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/img/2020-damien/bmw.png\" width=\"400\" alter=\"Battery being installed in car for convertion\" /></a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"reading-online-about-car-conversions-there-were-a-lot-of-concerns-raised-about-weight-distribution-torque-etc-can-you-tell-us-about-that\">Reading online about car conversions, there were a lot of concerns raised about weight distribution, torque, etc. Can you tell us about that?</h2>\n\n<p>One of the biggest problems when learning about car conversions is misinformation. A typical myth is about how Lithium batteries will burn down your house and car, which is not true if used properly.</p>\n\n<p>People have been customising cars for the last 150 years. Any kind of custom car build will put weight, components, stresses and mechanical differences into what is a mass manufactured vehicle. This is why it&rsquo;s so important to have car people involved in making conversions, so you don&rsquo;t make mistakes that are easily avoidable.</p>\n\n<p>For me the main driver is to be able to use modern OEM parts in car conversions. This is the next big leap that will enable us to get away from the idea that conversions need to cost €100,000 and they don&rsquo;t.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-are-you-working-on-at-the-moment\">What are you working on at the moment?</h2>\n\n<p>I am designing an open source control system for the Tesla model 3 drive units. This work is interesting and “cool”.  However, the most important thing I am working on at the moment is being able to reuse the Toyota and Lexus hybrid parts. These parts are more readily available, much more affordable and also (I will be roasted by the Tesla community of course by saying this) they are much more robust than their Tesla counterparts. They don&rsquo;t have the horsepower figures that Tesla parts do, but at the end of the day that is not necessarily what people need or want. What I am trying to do is to make it so that these components can be used outside of their parent vehicle.  It is about developing the hardware and the most importantly, the software solutions that enable us to use these parts in cars that were not designed for them.</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fg-BKxNlwjg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<h2 id=\"when-you-mention-the-open-source-parts-do-you-mean-the-boards-the-chip-or-everything-combined\">When you mention the open source parts do you mean, the boards, the chip or everything combined?</h2>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s everything, all those elements, generally combined. Interestingly, for the Model 3 batteries, I am also excited to be using FPGAs for the first time.</p>\n\n<p>On this side of things, a big enabler that we discovered in the last six months is a Chinese company called <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JLCPCB\">JLCPCB</a> where I can print a handful of circuit boards for very little money, meaning that we can try things and progressively improve them.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EvBmw/status/1235266962516832258\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/img/2020-damien/jlcpcb.png\" width=\"400\" alter=\"pcb boards\" /></a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-do-you-design-the-boards\">How do you design the boards?</h2>\n\n<p>There are many different packages you can use. I use <a href=\"https://www.rs-online.com/designspark/pcb-software\">Design spark PCB</a>.  These are multilayered boards, which are good for signal integrity, noise isolation and unity. Fortunately this is a process that JCBPLC supports.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-your-relationship-with-open-source\">What is your relationship with open source?</h2>\n\n<p>It can be very hard to open source something, you put a lot of work into it and it can be discouraging to get negative comments&hellip; at the same time it is encouraging to know that people are using what you worked on and even better when they contribute back. I especially appreciate that on the software side, since I am not very good at it. <a href=\"https://github.com/jsphuebner\">Johannes Hübner</a> is a huge part of this, he designed the [Open Inverter System](https://openinverter.org/, I think if he wasn&rsquo;t doing what he&rsquo;s doing I probably wouldn&rsquo;t be doing what I am doing. I mean, there are lots of really good people out there too, but Johannes is a key enabler for me.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-did-you-come-across-johannes-hübner\">How did you come across Johannes Hübner?</h2>\n\n<p>Around 2014 I got my first AC motor inverter and it was all closed source, after looking at this from a pure reliability point of view I thought, I am not putting this in my car! Too much that can go wrong! So I started looking around for alternatives, and found this website selling a kit, an open source AC motor controller and it was really simple, to the point I thought that it couldn&rsquo;t be real, but I bought a kit for about €60 and when it arrived, I built the thing and got the motor turning!  We kept in touch from there on. In some ways this is how Open Inverter started. ## How does one convert a car?</p>\n\n<p>Well, how long is a piece of string?</p>\n\n<p>When doing a conversion, you are trying to place a component that was never meant to be there, so, of course, nothing fits. You will weld, cut, create bracketry, line stuff up, you need to be able to use a milling machine etc.  The good news is that the custom car community are very familiar with these processes, they have been putting things that weren&rsquo;t meant to be there for a long time.</p>\n\n<p>Talking to custom car people is a good place to start if you want to do a conversion. Most of them are very interested, because they like doing things that haven&rsquo;t been done before. They get a car because it&rsquo;s something that defines them, they want to put their own individuality into it. For example, I got a BMW 8 series that has a Tesla Model S drive unit, the only reason I could do that is because I know a very talented custom car person called Dave Gormley, he had to engineer a complete rear subframe for this car.</p>\n\n<p>So, anyway, the main steps for converting a car, at a high level are:</p>\n\n<p>Drive train work. Talk to custom car people or get on working if this is you.</p>\n\n<p>Engine conversion : post about your project on the <a href=\"https://openinverter.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=11&amp;sid=968c37cbc5f381d7d02f6748c41e55f3\">Open inverter forum projects section</a> for integration.</p>\n\n<p>Battery: easier now, depends on your budget and availability.</p>\n\n<p>Vehicle integration: The good news here is that most modern cars started using a lot of electrically driven accessories that would traditionally be engine driven, for example: power steering , brake vacuum system, air conditioning, all these are 12 volt driving. Driving instruments and all that, varies from simple analog systems all the way to CAN, so when you are converting a car you need to go through each system and solve the problems as they arrive.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"last-words\">Last words</h2>\n\n<p>A place to start is to be in the <a href=\"https://openinverter.org/forum/index.php\">Open Inverter forum</a>, we try to keep the level of misinformation there to a minimum. Go there, read the forum and do something! Don’t forget, the most important tool is that bit between your two ears!</p>\n\n<p>Thanks so much to Damien Maguire for his time and doing this interview for Coders4Climate.</p>")) ((p+ #"/home/andrmag1/repos/z-misc/c4c-website/_src/posts/2019-11-17-voting-with-your-wallet.md" . unix) f post (u .

A lot of the carbon offseting companies are Charities or  Not for Profit organisations, but not all.</p>\n\n<p>A good post on the subject of <a href=\"https://charlieontravel.com/carbon-offset-flights/\">How to carbon offset flights</a> which goes in depth into the common questions and what are the problems with it. It seems like not many people know about this as a possibility.</p>\n\n<p>We found another really in depth post in <code>Ethical consumer</code>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/energy/short-guide-carbon-offsets\">&ldquo;A short guide to carbon offsets&rdquo;</a>. Interestingly, their recommendation is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>We recommend offsetting at the level of individual projects (rather than just giving to a company’s whole portfolio) because this is the level at which there is most information available. Accordingly, most of this feature deals with how best to choose such a project&hellip;</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>If you want to buy official offsets, we recommend giving to Gold Standard-approved wind or solar energy projects. You can find Gold Standard VER projects on the Gold Standard website and you can buy Gold Standard CERs directly through the UN’s platform&hellip;</p></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n <p>Recommended offset types – renewables There is a strong argument that renewables are the best form of official offset, as they are addressing the central structural issue that is causing climate change: our reliance on using fossil fuels for energy&hellip;</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, we keep collecting our first hand experiences in <a href=\"https://github.com/coders4climatestrike/awesome-carbon-offset\">Awesome carbon offset</a> please add your own by sending a PR to the repository or let us know of better ways to offset the things we can&rsquo;t change.</p>")) ((p+ #"/home/andrmag1/repos/z-misc/c4c-website/_src/posts/2019-11-28-ecotalk.md" . unix) f post (u .

The phone network uses the money we spend with them to give land back to nature, improving biodiversity. With an energy provider as a parent, you&rsquo;d expect they&rsquo;d allocate green energy to cover the network use, and they do.</p>\n\n<p>Ethical Consumer magazine rated all the networks in the UK, and Ecotalk came top by some distance. Those ratings are based on a wide range of factors (human rights, marketing, military support, political activity, tax avoidance, company ethos&hellip;) as well as green credentials.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"coverage-and-plans\">Coverage and plans</h1>\n\n<p>As a virtual mobile operator, Ecotalk uses EE infrastructure. After you switch you&rsquo;ll see EE as your network. (EE by themselves were a respectable 5th in the table; Ecotalk do better because of the good/non-evil things they do with the revenue).</p>\n\n<p>The plans include 2G, 3G and 4G. There&rsquo;s no mention of 5G, but that&rsquo;s not a concern for me. Maybe I&rsquo;ll be interested in a few years.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve not tried international roaming, but it&rsquo;s the <a href=\"https://www.ecotalk.co.uk/help/roaming-abroad/using-your-mobile-abroad\">roam like at home</a>-style for travelling in the EU.</p>\n\n<p>Ecotalk offer 12 month contracts and 30 day contracts. I went for the 12 months, 10G data, unlimited calls and texts. It&rsquo;s £12/mo including VAT (at the time of writing, November 2019).</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"joining\">Joining</h1>\n\n<p>Signing up is reasonably standard:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>adding a plan to your basket and checking out;</li>\n <li>providing contact and bank account direct debit details;</li>\n <li>entering (and verifying) your email address; and</li>\n <li>setting a user name and password.</li></ul>\n\n<p>You also get to set a &ldquo;credit limit&rdquo;, which is a kind of data overdraft. If you hit your data limit, but don&rsquo;t want Ecotalk to stop your usage, you can say you&rsquo;re willing to go over by up (for example) £30.  You can set this to zero.</p>\n\n<p>I did the sign up on Sunday night, and I received a new SIM in the post on Wednesday morning:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/2019-ecotalk/sim-840x570.jpg\" width=\"840\" height=\"570\" alter=\"Photo on an EcoTalk SIM card\" /></p>\n\n<h1 id=\"keep-your-number\">Keep your number</h1>\n\n<p>Keeping your existing phone number is so much easier than the last time I switched networks. With your existing SIM (for me, this was with Three), you text PAC to 75075, and you get back a code (a PAC) that&rsquo;s valid for 30 days. I also received a confirmation from Three that &ldquo;If [I] use [the PAC] today, [my] final bill will be 0 GBP&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>Once my Ecotalk SIM had arrived, I logged into my Ecotalk account and entered the PAC. It takes up to a couple of days to switch your number over. You&rsquo;re told to wait until you lose service from your existing network, then put in the new SIM and reboot.</p>\n\n<p>I did that, but my phone (and iPhone SE) was reporting a new phone number. I was expecting to see my old (existing) number. Porting isn&rsquo;t instant, and it looks like it flips over at 6pm each evening.</p>\n\n<p>At 6pm, I rebooted, and indeed my phone was showing my old number. (On Apple devices you can view your number by Settings &gt; Phone)</p>\n\n<p>I checked a few web sites, made some calls, sent some text. The main thing I wanted to check was: did data tethering work? Yes, and it was fast.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"support-email-slow-phone-great\">Support: email slow; phone great</h1>\n\n<p>I did email Ecotalk, and the automated response is that they&rsquo;ll get back in five working days. In reality, I had a response in one or two days. However, the telephone support is great.</p>\n\n<p>I phoned Ecotalk support once, expected to be in a queue for a while, but was speaking to a human pretty much instantly. They understood exactly what I burbled at them, and had the answer. Knowledgeable and fast.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"account-access-and-billing\">Account access and billing</h1>\n\n<p>Finally, online you can view your account. It looks like this:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/img/2019-ecotalk/account.png\" width=\"840\" height=\"1228\" alter=\"Screen shot of Ecotalk account page\" /></p>\n\n<p>You&rsquo;re billed in advance for the month, and the bill includes a VAT line, in case you need to expense that. If you&rsquo;re setting up your bill against a business, or need to change your direct debit, call them.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"summary\">Summary</h1>\n\n<p>Ecotalk is the most ethical phone network in the UK. It works. It&rsquo;s easy to switch. You should consider it.</p>")) ((p+ #"/home/andrmag1/repos/z-misc/c4c-website/_src/posts/2020-04-18-11-at-11-first-try.md" . unix) f post (u .
