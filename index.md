## Coders4ClimateStrike

Inspired by the call to action by [Greta Thunberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg) and the many ([1]) ([2]) ([3]) recent demostrations, we want to help, with *action*.

If you have some suggestions or want to get involved talk to us via twitter [@coders4Climate](https://twitter.com/Coders4Climate)

So, as a developer/programmer/coder, what can we do? Here is some suggestions of things you can change:

## Reducing carbon day to day

### Running and hosting applications:
 
 * Sign this: [Petition on sustainable servers](https://www.change.org/p/sustainable-servers-by-2024)
 * Some people did the research and these are good places to host (from a sustainability point of view): @GCPcloud @Azure or @awscloud BUT ONLY Dublin, Frankfurt, Canada or Oregon (these are the sustainable regions).
 * Tell others to host their applications at above and let the hosting poroviders know why you are using them or choosing to switch!
 
 
 * Don't Blockchain or bitcoin (or push for proof of efficiency as a consenus algo) ( learn why:
    -  [The guardian link](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/17/bitcoin-electricity-usage-huge-climate-cryptocurrency) 
    - [Talk explaining how blockchain works and the impact on the environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHUJaK2XzHg&feature=youtu.be)) 
 ) 


## Voting with your wallet


### Buying a phone?
 - What are the environmental costs in building machines? in getting components? are there ethical implications and alternatives? Influenced by the [fairphone talk](https://meaningconference.co.uk/videos/bibi-bleekemolen.php) and the actual [Fair Phone](https://www.fairphone.com/en/). 
   * A review for the Fairphone 3 by [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/18/fairphone-3-review-ethical-phone)


## Travel

If you have to travel by air, you can offset your carbon. We have compiled a list of [carbon offsetting companies](https://github.com/coders4climatestrike/awesome-carbon-offset), if you used one and you are happy with their work, feel free to tell us or simply send a PR to the [Awesome carbon offseting](https://github.com/coders4climatestrike/awesome-carbon-offset). 

## Education
