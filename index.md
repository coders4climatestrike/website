## Coders4ClimateStrike

Inspired by the call to action by [Greta Thunberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg) and the many [1] [2] [3] recent demostrations, we want to help, with action.

If you have some suggestions or want to get involved talk to us [@coders4Climate](https://twitter.com/Coders4Climate)

So, as a developer/programmer/coder, what can we do? Here is some ideas:

## Buying a phone?
 - What are the environmental costs in building machines? in getting components? are there ethical implications and alternatives? Influenced by the [fairphone talk](https://meaningconference.co.uk/videos/bibi-bleekemolen.php) and the actual [Fair Phone](https://www.fairphone.com/en/)

## Running and hosting applications:
 
 * Sign this: [Petition on sustainable servers](https://www.change.org/p/sustainable-servers-by-2024)

 * Tell others to host their applications at above and let the hosting poroviders know why you are using them or choosing to switch!
 * Don't Blockchain or bitcoin (or push for proof of efficiency as a consenus algo) ( learn why [The guardian link](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/17/bitcoin-electricity-usage-huge-climate-cryptocurrency) ... )
